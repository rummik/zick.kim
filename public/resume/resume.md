============================
Hi!  I am a self-automated individual, with over {since:2002} years of general
software development experience, around {since:2011} of which are represented
on [GitLab][] and [GitHub][]. I primarily design and build automation
systems that reduce developer workload, and have extensive experience creating
web applications, system applications targeting the CLI, and designing frontend
UI.

I also really enjoy working with others to build amazing things, wear hats,
write code, and chew bubble gum.

  I also try to avoid buzzwords, which is why you don't see 'self-motivated',
  'driven', 'full-stack', etc.  Those terms may apply, but I feel they attract
  the wrong kind of employer.

### Shellcast - Easy TTY broadcasting
Shellcast broadcasts a terminal to a public (or private) URL, usually on tty.tv.
The idea was to have something similar to twitch.tv, but for programmers,
MUD/Mush games, and anything that runs on the CLI.

- Tools: Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, Express, Underscore, Socket.io, Swig, PTY.js,
  Term.js
- <https://gitlab.com/chameleoid/tty.tv/shellcast>

### Telepathy - A telepathic password manager
I wanted a password manager that didn't store any information on a server,
but still had the ability to retrieve the right password from any device.

Telepathy solves this by using a user-supplied generation seed, username, and
domain name, then hashing (default is SHA256) and base converting the result.

It's also built with a responsive layout, and mobile webapp support.  (It
includes an icon used when being added to an Android/iOS homescreen, and looks
pretty on small screens ☺)

- Tools: Node.js, jQuery, Grunt, JSHint, Karma, Mocha, Swig, Stylus, HTML5, CSS3
- <https://gitlab.com/chameleoid/sykey/telepathy>


### 9k1.us  <!-- IT'S OVER 9000! -->
My personal, private, paste/file bin, and URL shortener.  It also provides
LMGTFY-like search functionality and a simple API for determining your public
IP.

- Tools: JavaScript (search), Typescript, Nest.js, Yarn, Node.js
