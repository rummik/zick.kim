============================
Hi!  I am a self-automated individual, with {since:2002} years of general
software development experience, around {since:2011} of which are represented
on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rummik).  I primarily design and build small web
applications, system applications targeting the CLI, and have experience
designing and building frontend UI.

I also really enjoy working with others to build amazing things, wear hats,
write code, and chew bubble gum.

<!--
  Incidientally, I also try to avoid buzzwords, which is why you don't see
  'self-motivated', 'driven', 'full-stack', etc.  Those terms probably apply,
  but I feel they attract the wrong kind of employer.  Also, this comment has
  the fun effect of those keywords showing up when I'm being searched for. ;)

### Shellcast / TTY.tv - Easy TTY broadcasting (November 2013 → Present)
Shellcast broadcasts a terminal to a public (or private) URL, usually on tty.tv.
The idea was to have something similar to twitch.tv, but for programmers,
MUD/Mush games, and anything that runs on the CLI.

- Tools: [Node.js][], HTML5, CSS3, [Express][], [Underscore][], Socket.io,
  [Swig][], PTY.js, Term.js
- <https://tty.tv>
- <https://github.com/rummik/shellcast>

### Telepathy - A telepathic password manager (September 2012 → Present)
I wanted a password manager that didn't store any information on a server,
but still had the ability to retrieve the right password from any device.

Telepathy solves this by using a user-supplied generation seed, username, and
domain name, then hashing (default is SHA256) and base converting the result.

It's also built with a responsive layout, and mobile webapp support.  (It
includes an icon used when being added to an Android/iOS homescreen, and looks
pretty on small screens ☺)

- Tools: [Node.js][], jQuery, [Grunt][], [JSHint][], Karma, [Mocha][], [Swig][],
  [Stylus][], HTML5, CSS3

- <https://gitlab.com/chameleoid/telepathy>


### 9k1.us (October 2013) <!-- IT'S OVER 9000! -->
My personal, private, paste/file bin, and URL shortener.  It also provides
LMGTFY-like search functionality and a simple API for determining your public
IP.

- Tools: JavaScript (search), Typescript, Nest.js, Yarn, [Node.js][]
